# Image Preprocessing and Analysis: 1st Set of Exercises
This repository contains the solutions for the first set of exercises for the Image Preprocessing and Analysis course. The solutions are provided in a Jupyter Notebook, which includes code, explanations, and visual outputs for each task.

## Repository Contents
The repository's structure is designed to be clear and easy to navigate. The primary deliverable is the notebook, which addresses the following exercises:

- **Exercise 1**: Grayscale Image Transformation. An analysis of a specific transformation function's impact on image intensity and brightness, with a practical demonstration on a chosen image.

- **Exercise 2**: Image Enhancement. A proposed method for improving the perceived light and color of the nature_dark_forest.jpg image.

- **Exercise 3**: Perceived Brightness. A method to enhance the perceived brightness of the pollen-500x430px-96dpi.jpg image.

- **Exercise 4**: Image Sharpening. A technique for sharpening the First-photo-of-the-moon-from-Chandrayaan2_ISRO.jpg image.

- **Exercise 5**: Combined Spatial Enhancement. An attempt to reverse-engineer a series of processing steps that transformed image_1 into image_2 and a proposal for a pipeline to perform the inverse transformation.

- **Exercise 6**: Edge and Corner Detection. A solution to find the main edges and corners in image11.jpg, including estimating the angle of specific edges and using corners to locate windows.

- **Exercise 7**: Object Analysis and Alignment. Estimation of the angle of a billiard cue in image31.jpg and a method to combine image31.jpg and image32.jpg to produce an image similar to image33.jpg.

## Getting Started
To view and run the notebook, you will need to have Jupyter or Google Colab installed. The notebook includes all the necessary code and comments for each exercise.
